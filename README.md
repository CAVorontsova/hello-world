# hello-world
my first repository


Hello to all users of the GitHub!

I'm Kate! I'm new at programming, but I want to know more! I like to know about web-development and became full-stack developer.
I know a little bit HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Nowadays I started to study with OdinProject. It will be a great pleasure for me to take part in any open-sourse project connected with the web-development.
